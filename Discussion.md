The main aim of this project is to develop a system that plays 2048 like a human does.  Specifically this translates to 
two concrete goals.

1. Develop a dsl to specify a set of rules to solve 2048.
2. Develop the actual rules.

Although this project is specific to the game 2048, it is intended to work as a stepping stone
for the development of a more generic DSL that can be used by an entity that can substitute humans in many diverse situations.
